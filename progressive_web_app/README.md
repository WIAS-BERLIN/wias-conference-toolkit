# Progressive Web App for WIAS Conference Toolkit #

This tool generates a human-readable overview over the events in the conference.
In this current early stage, the html output is not as useful as the name "progressive web app" suggests.

## Options

Currently the output-formats "plain" and "html" can be chosen, by providing the respective string as command line parameter.
"html" creates the html-files in the subdirectory "out/" and "plain" prints to stdout.
